    <h1>Broccoli and Stilton Soup</h1>
    <img src="soup.jpg" style="height:300px; width:400px;">
    <p>Broccoli and stilton is a classic flavour combination, and this verdant green homemade version of the traditional soup can be made as creamy or as cheesy as you like.

    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head broccoli, florets trimmed, stalk chopped</li>
        <li>Knob of butter for frying</li>
        <li>Olive oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 celery sticks, chopped</li>
        <li>1 large leek, chopped</li>
        <li>4 spring onions, chopped (or 2 large salad onions)</li>
        <li>2 vegetable stock pots/cubes</li>
        <li>150g stilton, crumbled</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Add the broccoli florets and blanch for 3-4 minutes until tender. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a bowl of ice water and set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour the cooking water into a large measuring jug and top up with fresh water so you have 1.5 litres in total. Set aside with the broccoli.</li>
        <li>To the same pan, add the butter and a splash of oil. Add the broccoli stalks and remaining veg, season, then cook over a medium-low heat until softened – about 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add back the cooking water with the stock pots, then simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the broccoli florets to heat through, then use a stick blender (or a regular blender if you prefer) to purée the soup until smooth.</li>
        <li>Check the seasoning and stir in the stilton.</li>
    </ol>
